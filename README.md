# Deep Reinforcement Learning Applications Course

This course covers advanced sequential decision-making topics in AI and is divided into two main parts focusing on:
* Deep Reinforcement Learning Theory
* Deep Reinforcement Learning Applications
* Deep Reinforcement Learning combines the principles of reinforcement learning and deep learning to solve complex sequential decision-making problems. This is a project-based course, with extensive hands-on exercises using PyTorch/TensorFlow, providing students an opportunity to improve their GitHub profiles by working on course projects.

## ðŸ“˜ Modules
Module 1: Deep Reinforcement Learning Theory

* Introduction to major deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
* Overview of the modeling process and programming.

Module 2: Deep Reinforcement Learning Applications

* Case studies on practical applications in various industries.
* Main case studies include Product Recommendations and Personalization for marketing/retail/E-commerce.

## ðŸš€ Pre-Requisites
* Understanding of main concepts of calculus, linear algebra, and probability & statistics.
* Foundational level of proficiency in Python programming, Git/GitHub, and command-line operations.
* Experience in training/testing machine learning models using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
* Foundational level of proficiency in deep learning applications is helpful but not required.
* Knowledge of reinforcement learning is not required; it will be reviewed during the course.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Identify Problems: Recognize types of problems (e.g., product recommendations, personalization) which deep reinforcement learning can help solve.
* Modeling Process: Explain and perform the steps of the deep reinforcement learning modeling process.
* Algorithm Understanding: Explain the pros/cons, assumptions, mathematical intuition, and use cases for the major types of deep reinforcement learning algorithms.
* Address Issues: Describe the distribution shift issue and online-offline tradeoff and apply best practices in building effective deep reinforcement learning models.
* Evaluate Performance: Evaluate and interpret deep reinforcement learning model performance.

### ðŸ’» Setup and Installation
Instructions for setting up the development environment and installing the necessary libraries and frameworks will be provided.
